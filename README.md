Rotten Potatoes is a movie watch list application that runs in the browser and allows a user to search for movies by title, retrieve information about the movie, view a movie trailer, and add the movie to their watch list.  The purpose of this application is to help make it easier for the user to make a decision on what movie to watch in an age when the user has too many options to choose from.

At the start of the application, the user is presented with an input field where they can enter a movie title.  After typing in a movie title, the user can then click the search button.  After doing so, the application will then present the following:
* Movie poster
* Movie title
* Plot
* Genre
* Runtime
* Release date
* Director name
* Actor names
* A youtube link to the movie trailer
* IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic ratings
* *Add to Watch List* and *Remove from Watch List* buttons

When the *Add to Watch List* button is clicked for a movie, that movie will appear as a button in the *Watch List* section at the bottom of the page. The user can then create a list of many movies to add to their watch list.  By clicking one of the movies in their watch list, the user is then presented with all of the information listed above for that movie.  Once the user has watched a movie on their watchlist (or if they no longer wish to watch that movie), they can click the *Remove from Watch List* button to remove that movie from their watch list.

This application was created using technologies such as:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Font Awesome
* Google Fonts
* Bulma
* The Open Movie Database API (https://www.omdbapi.com/)
* IMDb API (https://imdb-api.com/)

Some of the methods used in creating this application were found from resources such as W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and Stack Overflow.
